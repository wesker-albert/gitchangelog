3.0.4 (2018-03-17)
------------------

Fixes
~~~~~
- Conform to PEP479 as required by python 3.7 (fixes #101) [Valentin
  Lab]


3.0.3 (2017-04-23)
------------------

Fixes
~~~~~
- API cli change not documented about implicit ``HEAD`` removed in
  revision list specifier. (fixes #81) [Valentin Lab]

  In 2.5.1, ``gitchangelog show ^3.0.0`` command would implicitly add a
  ``HEAD`` in the revlist specifiers, effectively being equivalent to
  ``0.0.3..HEAD``.

  This behavior is removed in 3.0.0+ to stick to ``git rev-list REVLIST``
  syntax.  As a consequence, ``gitchangelog ^3.0.0`` won't select any
  revision and thus will cast an error about no commits matching revlist.


3.0.2 (2017-04-21)
------------------

Fixes
~~~~~
- [mustache/markdown] template is now compatible with incremental
  changelog generation patterns. (fixes #80) [Valentin Lab]


3.0.1 (2017-03-17)
------------------

Fixes
~~~~~
- Support of commits with empty message. (fixes #76) [Valentin Lab]


3.0.0 (2017-03-17)
------------------

New
~~~
- Template path can now be specified in ``git config``. (fixes #73)
  [Valentin Lab]
- Added ``FileRegexSubst`` to allow updatable incremental recipe.
  [Valentin Lab]

  With the added function and recipe as an example, you can update a
  current unreleased changelog additionaly to the traditional incremental
  behavior. ``FileRegexSubst`` might prove itself to be more powerfull
  tahn ``FileInsertAtFirstRegexMatch`` if you handle fairly complex regexes.
- Configurable ``publish`` action to allow more automated changelog
  scenarios (fixes #39) [Valentin Lab]

  In particular, projects using incremental changelog generation can now
  fully automate the process by using a ``publish`` action that inserts
  new sections in an existing changelog file.
- ``unreleased_version_label`` can now be computed on the fly. [Valentin
  Lab]

  This can let you rename the first section about non yet tagged commit
  more precisely. For instance by using the commit hash or any git
  property.
- Full tested windows support added. [Valentin Lab]
- Reference config file is not anymore required. (fixes #54) [Valentin
  Lab]
- New ``revs`` config file option allowing dynamically setting target
  rev-list. (fixes #61) [Valentin Lab]

  With this option, incremental changelog become more streamlined. With
  prior behavior, you had to know which was the last version prior to
  calling ``gitchangelog``. Now, calling ``gitchangelog`` alone can generate
  the exact last missing part thanks to this new config option.
- Templates now support direct path to files (fixes #46, fixes #63).
  [Héctor Pablos, Valentin Lab]

  Note that relative paths will be searched from the git toplevel.
- Provide helpers to integrate ``Co-Authored-By`` trailer value. (fixes
  #69) [Valentin Lab]

  You can use now ``commit["authors"]`` in templates to get a list of all
  authors of a commit. See the mako template ``restructuredtext.tpl`` for
  example of usage. Mustache templates gets also their own baked in joined
  list of authors through ``commit["author_names_joined"]``.
- Provide complete access on commit API to templates (fixes #18)
  [Valentin Lab]
- Supports trailer key values support. [Valentin Lab]
- Windows compatibility. [Jean-Baptiste Lab, Laurent LAPORTE, Michele,
  Valentin Lab]

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Use tagger date when tags are annotated instead of commit date. (fixes
  #60) [Valentin Lab]
- Removed the need of the ``show`` positional argument. [Valentin Lab]
- Suppression of the obsolete ``gitchangelog init`` command. [Valentin
  Lab]

Fixes
~~~~~
- Support closed or closing pipes on gitchangelog's stdout gracefully.
  [Valentin Lab]

  Python would output some angry comments for instance when using::

       gitchangelog | head

  Now it is much more graceful and will let the process finish earlier
  without complaining.
- Revlist would not work as expected on windows. [Valentin Lab]

  Windows does not support single quotes in command line as linux
  does. Fortunately there is no requirements on singles quotes so they
  were removed everywhere, ensuring a better windows compatibility.
- Using revlists could display unwanted commits or no commits. [Valentin
  Lab]

  This was happening when specifying revisions that didn't match
  commits tagged by tags matching the ``tag_filter_regexp``.
- Ability to specify rev-lists for partial changelogs creation was not
  working on windows. [Valentin Lab]
- Encoding issues prevented log to be outputed on specific windows
  versions. [Valentin Lab]
- Fixed encoding issue when reading UTF-8 git logs with a different
  default locale. [Valentin Lab]

  Windows platform were more likely to get hit by this bug as their
  default code page is not ``utf-8``. It was fixed by using an explicit
  encoding when reading git logs. The default value for this encoding
  can now be set in the ``gitchangelog``'s config file, per-repository.
  Although, this option should be only set in pathological configuration
  as the default behavior is to use ``git config i18n.logOutputEncoding``
  when set, or if not set, ``utf-8``, which is the default log encoding
  of git.


2.5.1 (2015-11-11)
------------------

Fixes
~~~~~
- Reference config is used for defaults. [Tuukka Mustonen]
- Error message when called in non-git directories was not correctly
  displayed on python 3. [Valentin Lab]
- ``--debug`` argument would generate command line arguments parsing
  errors on python 2.7.  (fixes #66) [Valentin Lab]


2.5.0 (2016-10-16)
------------------

New
~~~
- Hide unexpected traceback per default and allow them to be displayed
  if wanted. [Valentin Lab]
- New lines fixes in current default ReST format (fixes #62) [Stavros
  Korokithakis]

  These were modified:

  - no new line between list element, except when there's some
    body message to display, then use only one new line at the
    beginning of the body to issues with possible lists in body.
  - one new line before section titles.
  - two new lines before versions titles.

Fixes
~~~~~
- Output warning on stderr in some weird cases (fixes #52) [Valentin
  Lab]

  If no tag are found in the repository, or no tag matches the filter
  regex, or if all commits are ignored... this will lead to disturbing but
  legit outputs from ``gitchangelog``. So as to help diagnose what is
  going on, additional warnings are then printed when edge cases are
  encountered.
- [mustache/restructuredtext] avoid HTML-escaping content of variables
  (fixes #64) [Mark Milstein]


2.4.0 (2015-11-10)
------------------

New
~~~
- Add optional positional argument ``REVLIST`` to allow incremental
  changelog output (fixes #26) [Valentin Lab]

  See use cases documentations for more information.


2.3.0 (2015-09-25)
------------------

Fixes
~~~~~
- Nasty hidden bug that would break python3 (fixes #27) [Valentin Lab]

  Actually this bug was revealed by python3 random hashes (thanks to
  @rschoon for the hint) and could be reproduced on python2.7 with ``-R``
  mode.

  The ``git show`` command actually will behave differently if given a tag
  reference and print random unexpected information before using the
  format string. This would prefix a lot of mess to the first field being
  asked in the format string.

  And this first field is dependent on the internal order of a dict, and
  this order is not important as such, and so nothing was done on this
  part.

  On python2.7, somehow, it would always be the same order that revealed
  to have no consequence (probably one of the rare field not used in
  current changelogs).

  Python3 or Python2.7 -R would shuffle this order and then trigger the
  error whenever this prefix would be appended to actually important
  fields that went into some further processing (as casted to int for
  the timestamp for instance).


2.2.1 (2015-06-09)
------------------

Fixes
~~~~~
- Fix: doc: ``ìnclude_merge`` options was wrongly typed in sample config
  files (reported by @tuukkamustonen, fixed #29). [Valentin Lab]
- Updated doc to reflec that there are no support of windows for now.
  (fixes #28) [Valentin Lab]

  Actually windows will fail on ``subprocess`` call. (see #28)
- Remove commit's meta-information footer from changelog output. (fixes
  #25) [Valentin Lab]

  Some various tools (thinking of Gerrit) might leave some
  meta-information in the footer of your commit message's body that you do
  not want to be repeated in your changelog. So all values in the footer
  are removed (This concerns ``Change-Id``, ``Acked-by``, ``CC``,
  ``Signed-off-by``, ``Bug`` ... and any other value).


2.2.0 (2015-01-27)
------------------

New
~~~
- Provide support for older config file format. [Valentin Lab]
- Added 'octobercms-plugin' mako template. (fixes #16) [Valentin Lab]
- Added ``body_process`` and ``subject_process`` options. (fixes #22)
  [Valentin Lab]

  These options superseeds ``replace_regexps`` and ``body_split_regexp``
  as they provide a full control over text transformation of the subject
  or the body of the commit before they get included in the changelog.
- Added ``include_merge`` option to filter out merge commit. [Casey
  Duquette]

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Produce a more linear commit history (fixes #14) [Casey Duquette]

  Instead of retrieving the git log ordered by date, retrieve the log as
  a difference between tags to produce a more accurate view of changes
  between releases.

  For instance, imagine this git graph::

    * 6c0fd62 (HEAD, tag: sprint-6, origin/smoke, smoke, develop)
    *   5292a28 Merge back to develop
    |\
    | * 6612fce (tag: sprint-5.1, origin/master, origin/HEAD, master) super important hotfix
    * | 7d6286f more development work
    * | 8c1e3d6 continued development work
    * | fa3d4bd development work
    |/
    * ec1a19c (tag: sprint-5)

  Previously, commits ``fa3d4bd``, ``8c1e3d6``, ``7d6286f`` that
  occurred on the develop branch before the hotfix that led to tagging
  ``sprint-5.1``, were captured in the changelog under release
  ``sprint-5.1`` because of the order of the commits. But it is obvious
  that these commits were not included in a release until
  ``sprint-6``. The new method of calculating the changelog will capture
  this and reflect it properly, assigning those changes to ``sprint-6``.

Fixes
~~~~~
- Last commit was omitted (fixes #23). [Valentin Lab]
- Bogus messages when template didn't exist. [Valentin Lab]

  Refactored out the common code and corrected the bad error message.
- Removed hypothetical memory exhaust while parsing ``git log``.
  [Valentin Lab]

  Parse stdout as it's produced by git log by chunks.


2.1.2 (2014-04-25)
------------------

Fixes
~~~~~
- Fail with error message when config path exists but is not a file.
  (fixes #11) [Casey Duquette]

  For example, the config file could be a directory.


2.1.1 (2014-04-15)
------------------

Fixes
~~~~~
- Removed exception if you had file which name that matched a tag's
  name. (fixes #9) [Valentin Lab]


2.1.0 (2014-03-25)
------------------

New
~~~
- Python3 compatibility. [Valentin Lab]
- Much greater performance on big repository by issuing only one shell
  command for all the commits. (fixes #7) [Valentin Lab]
- Add ``init`` argument to create a full ``.gitchangelog.rc`` in current
  git repository. [Valentin Lab]
- Remove optional first argument that could specify the target git
  repository to consider. [Valentin Lab]

  This is to remove duplicate way to do things. ``gitchangelog`` should be run
  from within a git repository.

  Any usage of ``gitchangelog MYREPO`` can be written ``(cd MYREPO;
  gitchangelog)``.
- Use a standard formatting configuration by default. [Valentin Lab]

  A default `standard` way of formatting is used if you don't provide
  any configuration file. Additionaly, any option you define in your
  configuration file will be added "on-top" of the default configuration
  values. This can reduce config file size or even remove the need of
  one if you follow the standard.

  And, thus, you can tweak the standard for your needs by providing only partial
  configuration file. See tests for examples.
- Remove user or system wide configuration file lookup. [Valentin Lab]

  This follows reflexion that you build a changelog for a repository and
  that the rules to make the changelog should definitively be explicit and
  thus belongs to the repository itself.

  Not a justification, but removing user and system wide configuration files
  also greatly simplifies testability.

Fixes
~~~~~
- Encoding issues with non-ascii chars. [Valentin Lab]
- Avoid using pipes for windows compatibility and be more performant by
  avoiding to unroll full log to get the last commit. [Valentin Lab]
- Better support of exotic features of git config file format. (fixes
  #4) [Valentin Lab]

  git config file format allows ambiguous keys:

      [a "b.c"]
          d = foo
      [a.b "c"]
          e = foo
      [a.b.c]
          f = foo

  Are all valid. So code was simplified to use directly ``git config``.
  This simplification will deal also with cases where section could be
  attributed values:

      [a "b"]
          c = foo
      [a]
          b = foo

  By avoiding to parse the entire content of the file, and relying on
  ``git config`` implementation we ensure to remain compatible and not
  re-implement the parsing of this file format.
- Gitchangelog shouldn't fail if it fails to parse your git config.
  [Michael Hahn]

------------------

New
~~~
